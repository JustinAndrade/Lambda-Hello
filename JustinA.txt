Hello, my name is Justin.

Three words that describe me are "outgoing" "passionate" "funny"

Some things I enjoy doing in my free time are, playing League of Legends.  I also enjoy going to the gym, as-well as studying up on code and playing with my dog (blue nose pitbull).

My favorite animal would probably be a lion, due to their overwhelming courage.  Also Lion King played a huge part!

My favorite musical artist is 2pac.
